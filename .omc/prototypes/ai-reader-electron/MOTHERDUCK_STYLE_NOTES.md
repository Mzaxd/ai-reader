# MotherDuck Multi-Page Style Notes

This prototype refresh references patterns observed across multiple MotherDuck pages (not only homepage):

- Home: `https://motherduck.com/`
- Product: `https://motherduck.com/product/`
- Product for app developers: `https://motherduck.com/product/app-developers/`
- Product for data teams: `https://motherduck.com/product/data-teams/`
- Pricing: `https://motherduck.com/pricing/`
- Case studies: `https://motherduck.com/case-studies/`
- Blog: `https://motherduck.com/blog/`
- About: `https://motherduck.com/about-us/`
- Trust and security: `https://motherduck.com/trust-and-security/`

## Extracted direction

- Strong product narrative headers with direct value statements.
- High-density content sections (features, architecture, ecosystem, pricing/support blocks).
- Distinct mascot/illustration language ("duck" visual identity) instead of generic SaaS icons.
- Bold CTA tone (`Start Free`, `Try 21 Days Free`, `Get started free`).
- Clean, geometric component rhythm that supports fast scanning.

## Applied in this prototype

- Switched to "cartoon right-angle" component language: thick borders, small corner radius, flat offset shadows.
- Replaced soft glass style with clear block hierarchy and sticker-like tags.
- Kept high information density in core pages to mirror MotherDuck's efficient scanning experience.
- Updated typography to stronger, editorial sans + mono accents for labels.
- Added a unified cross-page shell for all pages: `md-hero` + `cta-panel` + compact metric chips.
